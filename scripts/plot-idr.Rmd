This document depicts a graphical) summary of the results from the IDR analysis.
It shows for each available sample the number of replicated peaks, both for the *within replicate selfconsistency* analysis and for the *between replicate* analysis (merged selfconsistency and rep1 vs rep2) as detailed below.

## Replicated peaks per sample
We look at the number of reproducible peaks identified per sample. Overall, we see the number of peaks for the selfconsistency analysis of **each replicate** (rep1_selfconsistency, $rep1_{sc}$ and rep2_selfconsistency, $rep1_{sc}$), the number of reproducible peaks for the **merged repliceates** (merged_selfconsistency $merged_{sc}$) and the number of peaks reproducible **between the two replicates** (rep1_rep2, $rep_{1,2}$). For each sample, we calculated the ratios 
$$r_1 = {rep1_{sc} \over {rep2_{sc}}}$$
and
$$r_2 = {merged_{sc} \over {rep_{1,2}}}$$. 
These ratios can be used as an indicator of reproducibility: If both ratios, $r_1$ and $r_2$, show a more than two fold divergence (e.g. $r_1 > 2$ & $r_1 < 0.5$) the sample is said to show a low reproducibility, otherwise the reproducibility is said to be high enough for using both replicates as is [1].
```{r echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.width=10}
# load the result table for all samples
tab <- read.table(fsummary, header=T, sep="\t")
head(tab)

# prepare for plotting
melted <- melt(tab, id.vars = c("sample", "passed", "np_nt", "n1_n2"))
colnames(melted)[grepl("variable", colnames(melted))] <- "analysis"
n <- nrow(tab)

theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
             legend.position = "top")

# plot bar chart
ggplot(data=melted, aes(x=sample, y=value, fill=analysis)) + 
        facet_grid(passed ~ .) + 
        geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") + 
        labs(y="# peaks") + 
        ggtitle(paste0("IDR summary for ", n, " samples"))

```

The above plot shows the number of replicated peaks (y-axis) per sample and IDR sub-analysis (x-axis). The top row shows only samples where the number of replicated peaks indicate low reproducibility, whereas the bottom row shows the samples with a high reproducibility.
